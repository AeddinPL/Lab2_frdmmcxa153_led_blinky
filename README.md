# Lab 2: LED shines
*Lab2_frdmmcxa153_led_blinky*

In this lab we make some experience with the FRDM-MCXA153 board using the SDK project
to implement a simple LED blinking. Once we will get familiar with the example project, we
will integrate simple modifications to make use of the board support functions and defines.
